#expanation
1) lattice length along x and y direction, both should be even integers
2) inverse temperature
3) udv setting: number of udv decomposition and udv interval
4) random seed and initial random window
5) hopping strength and ratio
6) coupling strength (square root of g)
7) strength of dynamic, gradient, squared and quartic term
8) chemical potential and bias (plus-sign means orbital A has larger chemical potential)
9) number of cycles
